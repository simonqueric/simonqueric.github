## Internship at <i> L'Hôpital National de la Vision</i>
### Spring 2023

During the spring 2023, I worked as an intern at the National Vision Hospital. The topic was to extract biomarkers from retina images obtaine by Laser Doppler Holography. To that purpose, the team of M. Atlan at <i>L'Hôpital des XV-XX</i> needed a segmentation algorithm. With my colleague Jeanne Malécot, we experimented a U-Net architecture with a Frangi filter as a preprocessing step. Here is the github repository <a href="https://github.com/simonqueric/RetinaVesselSegmentation"> Retina Vessel Segmentation </a> and my <a href="../files/rapport_stage.pdf"> internship report </a>.
